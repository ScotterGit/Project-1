                    <p>Scott Condren is a digital artist and web developer living outside of Chicago.

                    His work "skulls" plays into his interest of mixing the macabre with the vibrant. Inspired by high-end material and Dia de Muertos he uses 3D software to create skulls that are constructed out of gold, metal, pearl, and others.  </p>

                <p>“I am inspired by customization, and the natural instinct of a person to ‘pick their favorite’. I am also highly interested in the ability of 3D rendering to create expensive looking objects, that, even though they cannot be held, can be admired. Because they do not exist in the physical world, they are inexpensive, but the pictures delight our senses similar to a beautifully constructed jewelry advertisement.</p>
                <P>The images I create could be thought of as pictures taken in the real world. You can imagine what they feel like: cold, hard, and heavy. Your imagination might wonder: where are these objects displayed? Why were they created? But most of all I hope you simply see one that sparks interest, and that you can call your favorite.”</P>
