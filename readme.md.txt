NAME: Scott Condren.
DESCRIPTION: A portfolio website.
DETAILS OF FUNTIONS: Home page with title, three column layout of images, a contact page with name and email fields.
TECHNOLOGIES USED: HTML, CSS, Figma.
IDEAS FOR FUTURE: 
	1. I would like to add some functionality that allows the user to click on the images to make them large. 
	2. I would like to set up a store so users could purchase prints from me.
	3. It would like to add a color picker so users could design their own skull.
